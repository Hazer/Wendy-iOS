## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Wendy-iOS is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Wendy'
```

## Intall template files

Wendy comes with some XCode template files to create `PendingTask`s and `PendingTaskFactory`s very quickly within XCode from the File > New File menu. 

All you need to do is run this bash script to install the scripts on your machine in the XCode templates directory:

```
./Templates/install_templates.sh
```

Restart XCode if it is currently open on your machine. 

Then, the next time you open XCode and go to "New file", you will see a section called "Wendy" with file templates inside!
