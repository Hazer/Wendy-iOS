# Wendy-iOS

**NOTE**. This repo is not yet ready to use in your iOS projects. It is not finished yet....but close :)

Here is the checklist to complete before it is released into `alpha` stage:

- [X] Setup project as a CocoaPod library. Setup CoreData, example iOS app to package with library.
- [X] Add the functionality to library to add tasks to it. 
- [X] Add functionality to library to run tasks that have been added previously.
- [ ] Add error reporting functionality into library.
- [ ] Build out the example iOS app packaged with the library more to test out the library more.

Check out [my Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/levimakesapps) to watch me build it live and view my archive of [past streams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi6LazKSCVOWAT2cYGiEgVQ) if you wish to see this library come to life.

As far as the library being in `alpha` stage, I plan on it being in `alpha` while the library gets installed and used in real world apps. **Wendy is already installed in production running apps today**, but I believe it needs a wee bit more uses before it can upgrade to `beta` and eventually `1.0` stage. Once in `beta`, I do not see the API changing any longer and only having bug fixes while it gets used in more apps by others. `beta` is a pretty safe place to use the library if you wish.
